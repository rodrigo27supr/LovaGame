# LovaGame: My First Java Project
![Bot Status](https://github.com/rodrigo27supr/LovaGame/actions/workflows/ejecutar.yml/badge.svg)

Hi, I'm **Rodrigo**, a Web Application Development student.

This repository is the starting point of my professional portfolio: **LovaGame**.

## The story behind the code

My goal with this project was to move beyond theory and build something useful and functional.

To achieve this, I have relied on **Gemini AI as my mentor**, but I want to clarify that **I haven't just copied and pasted code without stopping to think**.

I followed these steps to make the project as educational as possible:

- The code was written by me, step by step.
- I commented on several lines of code with AI assistance to explain the "why" and ensure I understood the logic of the loops, connections, and files used.
- I didn't want it to stay on my computer, so I learned how to configure GitHub Actions to run it in the cloud.

## What does LovaGame do?

It is a bot developed in **Java** that:
1. Scans the internet every hour looking for 100% free video game deals.
2. Filters the results to avoid duplicate alerts (using a history log).
3. Sends an alert to my Telegram broadcast channel.

## Technologies I've used in my project
In this project, I have put into practice:
* **Java 17:** Object handling, lists, and flow control.
* **REST APIs:** Consuming external data in JSON format.
* **Git & GitHub:** Version control and repository management.
* **GitHub Actions:** Cloud automation.
* **Security:** Secure management of tokens and passwords (Secrets).

## Version 1.1
I have updated the bot with visual improvements:

* **Multimedia Support:** Notifications now include the game's **cover art**.
* **Interactive Buttons:** I've added a **"Claim Deal"** button under each message to go directly to the store.
* **Optimization:** Cleaner and more efficient code.

## The final result
If you're curious, you can see the bot working in real-time on my broadcast channel:
